## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bentley Settin and welcome to my GitHub page!

    ðŸŒ± I recently graduated from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington with honors in Oceanography and a minor in Biology. 

    ðŸ”­ I am currently part of the M.S. Marine Science program at UNCW and am advised by Phil Bresnahan.

    ðŸ’¬ I love Jesus and I consider it an honor to serve others through science, soccer, and coffee (I couldn't find another s name haha)!
